# LearningApp3.3Backend
Backend written in ~one week.\
The goal was to allow users to create accounts,And save data correctly to a sql database.\
At this point i had ~2 weeks of experience of sql/php.\

Also in this project i setup some custom actions.\
We have a php validator and every commit on master will be autodeployed to the web server.\

Check the main LearningApp3.3 repo for the frontend.\
